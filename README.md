# Advent of Code Solutions

Personal repository of Advent of Code solutions.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after solving the first). You can learn more about it [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

## Running solutions (Python)

Using [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) to import input data.

```bash
pip install advent-of-code-data
```

Export your AoC session ID, for example:
```bash
export AOC_SESSION=cafef00db01dfaceba5eba11deadbeef
```
- *note*: Windows users should use `set` instead of `export`

The session ID is a cookie which is set when you login to AoC. Just login to your account, copy the sesssion cookie, and set as environment variable.
